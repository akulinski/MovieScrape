        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from facepy import GraphAPI
        
            # Initialize the Graph API with a valid access token (optional,
            # but will allow you to do all sorts of fun stuff).
            graph = GraphAPI(oauth_access_token)
        
            # Get my latest posts
            graph.get('me/posts')
        
            # Post a photo of a parrot
            graph.post(
                path = 'me/photos',
                source = open('parrot.jpg', 'rb')
            )
        
        Facepy can do more than reading your latest posts and posting photographs of parrots, but you'll have to
        `read the documentation <http://facepy.rtfd.org>`_ to find out how.
        
        Please note that Facepy does *not* do authentication with Facebook; it only consumes its API. To get an
        access token to consume the API on behalf of a user, use a suitable OAuth library for your platform (if you're
        using Django, for example, you might use `Fandjango <https://github.com/jgorset/fandjango>`_).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install facepy
        
        Contribute
        ----------
        
        * Fork `the repository <http://github.com/jgorset/facepy>`_.
        * Do your thing (preferably on a feature branch).
        * Write a test that demonstrates that the bug was fixed or the feature works as expected.

        Johannes Gorset made this. You should `tweet me <http://twitter.com/jgorset>`_ if you can't get it
        to work. In fact, you should tweet me anyway.
        
        I love Schibsted
        ----------------
        
        I work at `Schibsted Products & Technology <https://github.com/schibsted>`_ with a bunch of awesome folks
        who are every bit as passionate about building things as I am. If you're using
        Facepy, we probably want to hire you.

        ### Added
        - The HTTP headers of the response are now available in `response['headers']`.
        - `FacebookError` now has `fbtrace_id` to aid in debugging.

        ## 1.0.8 - 2016-01-26
        ### Fixed
        - Fixed an issue where `get_application_access_token` using Graph API versions 2.3+ would
          return JSON instead of a query string, resulting in an `AttributeError` to be thrown.
        
        ## 1.0.7 - 2015-09-08
        ### Fixed
        - Fixed an issue where `get_extended_access_token` using Graph API versions 2.3+ would
          return JSON instead of a query string, resulting in an `AttributeError` to be thrown.
        - `FacebookError` instances now contain additional data about the error.
        
        ## 1.0.6 - 2015-01-07

        - You may now specify the API version to use with `GraphAPI`.
        
        ## 1.0.4 - 2014-09-28
        ### Added
        - Facepy now proxies the error message from Facebook for 5XX responses.
        - Facepy now raises `FacebookError` on any response in the 5XX range.
        
        ## 1.0.3 - 2014-06-17
        ### Added
        - `FacebookError`, `HTTPError`, `OAuthError` and `SignedRequestError` are now available
        from the `facepy` module for convenience.
        - `GraphAPI` now raises `FacebookError` upon receiving HTTP 500 from Facebook.
        
        ## 1.0.2 - 2014-06-10
        ### Added
        - `GraphAPI` now accepts an argument `timeout`, which can be either `None` or an
        integer describing how many seconds to wait for a response.
        
        ## 1.0.1 - 2014-05-22
        ### Fixed
        - Fixed an issue where six would cause an `ImportError` unless already
        installed. It is now a direct dependency.
        
        ## 1.0.0 - 2014-05-22
        ### Added
        - `GraphAPI` now supports securing Graph API requests with application secret proofs.
        - `GraphAPI#post` now supports user-generated images.
        
        ### Fixed
        - The last bit of the tuple returned from `get_extended_access_token` is now `None`
        if the access token won't expire.
        - `GraphAPI#batch` can now handle more than 50 requests at a time.
        - Fixed a bug that caused unicode URLs to fail.
        
        ## 0.9.0 - 2014-02-12
        ### Added
        - Changed `GraphAPI` methods to return `decimal.Decimal` instances for floating-point
        numbers instead of `float`, which can cause precision losses not acceptable for
        financial operations.
        - Nested dictionaries, lists and sets are now automatically encoded as JSON.
        - You may now elect to not verify Facebook's SSL certificate.
        - You may now substitute colons with underscores in keys such as `fb:explicitly_shared`.
        - Facepy is now compatible with Python 3.

        ## 0.8.4 - 2012-11-13
        ### Fixed

        some keys for its "page" attribute.
        
        ## 0.8.3 - 2012-10-04
        ### Added

        - Fixed a bug that caused pagination to stop prematurely.
        
        ## 0.8.0 - 2012-06-22
        ### Added
        - You may now query application access tokens with `get_application_access_token`.
        - `SignedRequest.parse` now returns a dictionary describing the payload of the signed request
        instead of a `SignedRequest` instance.

        and no longer facilitates for constructing arbitrary signed requests.
        - `SignedRequest#generate` no longer requires the provision of `application_secret_key`.
        - `GraphAPI` now supports retries for `get`, `post`, `delete`, `search` and `fql`.
        - `GraphAPI#get` is now more intelligent about pagination and should no longer query Facebook for another page
        of results if the current page has less elements than `limit`.
        
        ### Removed
        - `SignedRequest#oauth_token` and `SignedRequest.OAuthToken` have been removed (deprecated since v0.6).
        
        ### Fixed
